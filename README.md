# 👋 Hi, I'm **Jarno Beyers**

### Web Development & Cloud student at **AP University of Applied Sciences** (Belgium)  
Passionate about **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Git**, **C#**, and learning modern web technologies.

I love building things, breaking things (accidentally 😅), fixing them again, and improving a little every day.  
GitHub is my playground where I turn ideas and school projects into real code.

- MySQL databases: modeling, queries, stored procedures  
- Git workflows: branching, PRs, merging  
- Cloud basics: Docker, reverse proxy demos  
- School labs (DigitAP / IT Essentials)

## ❤️ Things I Enjoy as a Developer
- Writing clean and understandable code ✨  
- Smart commit messages  
- Debugging until it finally works  
- Learning new languages, tools, and ideas  
- Slight panic when Git says *fatal error*,  
  followed by a hero moment when it gets fixed 😄
