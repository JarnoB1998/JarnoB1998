👋 Hey there! I'm Jarno Beyers

Web Development & Cloud student at AP University of Applied Sciences in Belgium.
Passionate about JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, Node.js, Express, Git, C#, Linux tools, and modern web design.

I love building things, breaking things (accidentally 😅), and most importantly: learning every single day.
GitHub is my playground where I experiment, improve, and turn classroom concepts into real code.

👨‍💻 Web development projects in JavaScript & TypeScript

📘 AP Hogeschool lab exercises (DigitAP / IT Essentials)

🌐 Building web servers with Node.js + Express

💾 Database design & SQL logic with MySQL

🔧 Git workflows (branches, pull requests, forking, merging)

🔍 Cloud & container basics with Docker and reverse proxy setups

🧠 What I'm Learning

⚡ Asynchronous programming (async/await, fetch, APIs)

🏗️ Fullstack TypeScript (TS → Node.js → Express)

🔐 Security basics (hashing, validation, sanitization)

❤️ What I Enjoy as a Developer

Writing clean, readable code ✨

Smart commit messages

Debugging until the problem gives up

Learning new technologies

Slightly panicking when Git says “fatal: … denied”

Then feeling like a hero when everything finally works 😄
